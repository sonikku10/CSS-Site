# CSS-Site
This mini CSS project is part of the 2019 Webdeveloper Bootcamp by Angela Yu from AppBrewery.
It demonstrates the visual improvements of incorporating CSS to supplement HTML and encourages the use of CSS to help format an HTML page.

This particular project is a self-introduction. A little about me. I'm diving head-first into the WebDev world.
Wish me the best of luck!

Thanks,
Lee
